Here is the implementation plan:

Implementation Plan for Cisco Router Change
Site Survey: Conduct a thorough site survey to assess current conditions and requirements. Evaluate the existing network infrastructure, identify potential challenges, and gather necessary data for the router change.

Equipment Installation: Install the new Cisco routers and ensure they are properly connected to the network. Verify physical connections, power supply, and placement to optimize network performance.

Software Configuration: Configure the new routers with the necessary software settings. Ensure compatibility with existing network infrastructure and applications. Apply firmware updates and configure network protocols, security settings, and routing tables.

Testing: Perform initial testing to ensure functionality and performance. Check connectivity, data transfer rates, and software integration. Conduct stress tests and security assessments to validate the change.
